Recently, I tried sending a form using JS. I was sure I didn't make typos and errors in my code. Turns out you can't set the name attribute of an input `submit` and use the JS function `submit()` at the same time. JS tries to access submit, finds the button and thinks: "Weird, this isn't a function". So, make sure you didn't set the name attribute of any input to `submit`. It can conflict with the JS function.
