Introduction:

- Anecdotal: prayer room in our school.
- Debate centers around the role of religion in public schools.
- Two viewpoints: complete ban vs indoctrination
  (Meanwhile over in the US, ...)
- The real world is more nuanced.
- Schools should not ban religious expression.

Arguments:

- School is not the place for religion.
  - Separation of state and church.
    - Public schools are organised by the state.
  - Religious expression in schools should not be payed by the government.
  - Schools shouldn't force religion on anyone & religious activities cannot be required.

Nice opener: Should we completely ban religious expression in public schools then?

- No, schools should stay neutral.
  - Public schools are for everyone => multiculturalism
    - That's a lot of different religions
    - The more important that the school stays neutral
      - To ensure everyone gets an equal chance at practising their religion

- However, religious expression can be limited by the school rules.
  - While everyone has the freedom and right to express themselves,
    this right does not stand above other rules, like a ban on harrasment or violence.
  - Support? Consitution, research etc?

- Moreover, religion should not be excluded from the formal school curriculum entirely.
  - However, schools should not teach religion itself 
    - That is, teaching the values and sentiment, beliefs of religions.
    - The constitution prohibits the indoctrination of students.
  - Knowledge about religions and other cultures can be very useful
    - In future jobs, relation/friendships and social interactions
  - Therefore they should be teaching **about** religion,
    - How it originated, how it spread etc.

Conclusion:

- In summary:
  - Schools should stay neutral in regard to religion.
  - Schools cannot organise religious activities, because that would violate the seperation of government and church.
  - Religious practise in school is totally fine, as long as it's within the boundries of the school rules.
  - Schools should teach about religion, instead of teaching the religion itself.
- Pose the question: prayer room?
- Yes, but it should be for everyone.
