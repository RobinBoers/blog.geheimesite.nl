Just like [last year](https://blog.geheimesite.nl/2021/01/dit-wil-ik-leren-in-2021.html) I'm writing about my goals and projects I want to complete this year. But first, how did I do last year? Well, in [this post](https://blog.geheimesite.nl/2021/07/waar-ben-ik-momenteel-in-mijn-plannen.html) I wrote about my progress in 2021. Quick recap:

- I wanted to learn Express (servers)
- I wanted to build GTK+ apps
- I wanted to learn React to build mobile apps with React Native
- I wanted to create 3D games and prototypes using Three.js

So, did I accomplish these goals? Well, sorta. I didn't do anything with GTK. Mostly because the docs suck, and for Node.js they are even worse. I might try [Granite](https://valadoc.org/granite/Granite.html) in the future. Who knows? But GTK and Linux deserve a whole post on their own.

I also got a bit distracted by [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), and I [wrote a little app](https://blog.geheimesite.nl/2021/08/hallo-svelte.html) using Svelte instead of learning React as I planned. I still want to learn React because I like the idea to write iOS and Android apps using React Native. I recently saw [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbhl379x1cw) about integrating React Native with [Phoenix Framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org), which sounds cool.

I totally forgot Express to be honest. That may also illustrate how much I was actually interested in it.

But to end on a positive note: I've got a job at [Qdentity](https://qdentity.nl) since September 2021. I mentioned Phoenix Framework earlier in this post, and that is because that is what they use at Qdentity. So I'm learning [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) and Phoenix now. Phoenix is a framework to build interactive websites and web apps in Elixir. You'll hear me talk about it a lot more this year, so be prepared :)

Oh, I almost forgot: my plans for this year. I already mentioned Phoenix and Elixir, but I'm also still interested in React and React Native. Also cool: I've got a new app I'm working on. It's called Nindo and I used it to publish this post before I transfered it to my own blog.

Happy new year everyone!
